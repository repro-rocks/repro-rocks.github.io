## Motivation

[Many scientists agree that there is an ongoing reproducibility crisis](https://www.nature.com/news/1.19970) within our community. This is certainly the anecdotal experience of the authors of repro.rocks who are academics and software engineers ourselves and have spent many hours sifting through code repositories trying to make experimental code work or to track down missing datasets.

Our primary motivation is to help academics who want to find and reproduce scientific work to avoid having to spend lots of time doing so.


## Goals

We have two primary goals at repro.rocks: a reactive goal and a proactive goal.

1. Firstly (**Reactive**), we want to help scientists, engineers, students and hobbyists (non-exclusive, anyone who's interested) to be able to access, understand and reproduce experimental code. This is a reaction to a lot of experimental code being very difficult or impossible to reproduce even within a very short timeframe of the work being published (e.g. 6-12 months). This is a particular problem in the field of deep learning where the primary authors of repro.rocks hail from.

2. Secondly (**Proactive**), we want to help  scientists, engineers, students and hobbyists (non-exclusive, anyone who's interested) to make their work accessible and reproducible for peers their peers. We hope to normalise the expectation that inter-disciplinery computer-aided-research should be accompanied by working, reproducable code that others can use easily months or even years after the work is published.

## FAQs

Here are some frequently asked questions about repro.rocks and answers

#### How can I get involved with repro.rocks?

Make sure to check out our [contributing to repro.rocks]({{< ref "docs/prologue/contributing.md" >}}) page.

#### Are you aware of [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/) and how does repro.rocks differ?

[PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/) is an amazing resource that makes it dead simple to find new state of the art ML papers and accompanying experimental (and sometimes mature) code and datasets. PapersWithCode is somewhat less opinionated than repro.rocks in the sense that they don't currently make public their views on code reproducibility or indeed provide any sort of criteria for how reproducible certain works are. 

We highly recommend PapersWithCode as a great resource when looking for existing code if you can't find what you need from our website.
